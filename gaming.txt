Latest Nintendo Direct Shares More 'Zelda,' Along With a Few Bonus Surprises
______________________
 Today's Nintendo Direct provided plenty of release dates and a few surprises.

Everyone who regularly follows along with Nintendo's online presentations (Nintendo Direct)
 is used to one or two disappointing omissions, but today's Direct didn't leave much out. 
 There may not have been any mention of Metroid Prime (the upcoming fourth game or otherwise), 
 but many big names were included in the lineup.

A new Fire Emblem, called Fire Emblem Engage, is headed for the Switch on January 20, 2023,
 and brings back the turn-based tile-driven combat of the classic series. And the popular
  Switch RPG Octopath Traveler is getting its own sequel a month later, on February 24. 
  Even Final Fantasy is making a comeback—sort of—with rhythm action game THEATRHYTHM FINAL 
  BAR LINE, expected to release on February 16.

Outside of the role-playing and role-playing-adjacent, it looks like fan favorite Golden Eye 
64 is headed to the Switch "soon" by way of the Switch Online + Expansion Pack membership.
 Nintendo Direct also surprised viewers with a teaser for Pikmin 4, due out sometime next year.

Bayonetta 3 received a release date, and it's much closer than expected: October 28. There were 
also a few scary games in the mix, with Fatal Frame: Mask of the Lunar Eclipse out in early 2023 
and cloud versions of the Resident Evil 2 and RE 3 remakes, RE 7, coming later this year. Resident
 Evil Village is also getting a cloud release due out on October 28, but a playable demo is also 
 available now.

But of course, the new Legend of Zelda had to wrap up the presentation with another brief teaser,
 but this time it included a full title and release date. The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom
  is expected to land on the Switch on May 12, 2023.

 How Do I Send Voice Messages via PS5?

To send a voice message on your PlayStation 5, start by pressing the PS button on your DualSense controller from the dashboard. In the Control Center at the bottom, select Game Base.

Select the Record button to begin recording the voice message – your DualSense controller has a built-in microphone, so just speak into it, like you do when issuing PS5 voice commands, to record. Keep in mind that you’ll only be able to record a 15-second voice message.

Before sending the message, you can listen to it. If you don’t like how it sounds, or you made a mistake, just hit the Record Again button to re-record the message.
Save Time Typing by Sending a Voice Message on PS5

You don’t always have to type a message when chatting with your friends on PlayStation 5. You also have the option to send a voice message, which can be a quick and fun way to communicate sometimes.

As long as you don’t mind speaking into your DualSense controller, sending a voice message on your PS5 is pretty easy.
